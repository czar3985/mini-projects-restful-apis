# RESTful API Mini-Projects

_These are my solutions to different exercises. Latest additions at the top._

**kale-google-oauth**

Allow users to access APIs using their Google accounts. Developer needs to create own client_secrets.json and 
replace the client_id on line 14 of clientOAuth.html.

**fruit-token-authentication**

Added token-based authentication to the log-in system

**bagel-user-registration**

/bagels exposes all of the bagels in the inventory but only registered users should be able to view 
it. Store user and password hashes in the database, allow user registration, protect
/bagels endpoint.

**find-restaurant-with-own-api**

In the API mashup that uses Google Maps API and Foursquare API to retrieve a restaurant
given a location and meal type, implement a database feature and your own API support.

**puppies-serialize**

Add a serialize decorator to the database model to create 
json objects from database query results.

**puppies-methods**

Respond to different types of requests. Indicate the methods for the 
endpoints.

an API endpoint.
